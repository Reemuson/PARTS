# PARTS Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the intended technical direction of PARTS.
It is not a timeline and does not imply delivery dates.

Items may move, change or be removed as the project evolves.

## Current Focus (v0.1)

- Core rendering engine stability
- JSON schema consistency
- Correct electrical symbol mapping
- JEDEC-aligned package geometry
- Mixed-component label sheets
- Documentation and examples

---

## Near-Term Goals

- Expanded JEDEC package coverage
- Config validation and clearer error reporting
- Better test coverage for package geometry
- Capacitor families
- Inductor families
- Integrated circuit families

---

## Medium-Term Goals

- Optional QR code support linking to datasheets
- User-defined branding (logos, colours)
- Config schema documentation

---

## Long-Term / Experimental

- KiCad symbol and footprint import
- Automatic datasheet parsing
- Batch inventory integration
- Custom layout templates
- UI for label data entry

---

## Non-Goals

PARTS intentionally does not aim to be:

- A full inventory management system
- A CAD tool replacement
- A BOM or ERP solution
